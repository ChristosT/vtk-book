# About this effort

The markdown chapters started with the textbook PDF. We used a PDF to HTML Converter followed by an HTML to Markdown converter. The resulting Markdown file requires lots of hand editing, but much of this editing is repetitive. For the most part we did not edit the text. This means that Tcl in-line code still remains. Also API changes and new features in VTK are not included. A rewrite of the text is a much larger effort and may happen in the future.

We did add code to link figure references to the figures. We used a set of [standard templates](https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-examples/blob/master/src/VTKBook/Figures/FigureTemplates.txt) to caption the figures. We also link all references to VTK classes to their Doxygen documentation.

We handle two special cases:

1) Equations - Berhdard Meehan encoded all of the 100 equations in the text into [Latex equations](https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-examples/blob/master/src/VTKBook/Figures/Equations.txt).

2) Figures - We used the [VTKBookFigures](https://kitware.github.io/vtk-examples/site/VTKBookFigures) to populate all of the figures generated by C++ or Tcl examples. Since Tcl is no longer supported, We translated the Tcl to C++ and Python. Also, Andrew Maclean created Python examples for all of the VTKBookFigures. Some figures do not have associated code, so we captured those figures from the PDF using screen captures.
